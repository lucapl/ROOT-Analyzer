# Data folder

The input data should be divided into 3 groups depending on the difficulty for example:
- easy: perfect view, the game elements are not covered with your hands when carrying it...
- medium: different dynamics of light in the picture, shadows, light reflections...
- difficult: same as the medium and angled view (a few or several degrees), game components partially covered with hands when moving, slight shaking of the camera...

Each data group should have at least 3 representative clips per difficulty (9 clips in total) length should not be less than 1 min, max 5 min per clip.
